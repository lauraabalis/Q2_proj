# Let's Eat!

Let's Eat! enables household members to plan meals according to what each person would like to eat for dinner on a given night. For example, a child may enter his or her desired food in the suggestion form. A parent may then accept or reject the suggested meal.

Team Letâ€™s Eat! used the following technologies to complete our project: Node.js, Express, Knex, PostgreSQL, EJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. On day one of our project, we used Pivotal Tracker to write and organize our stories. The next day, however, we did not follow the process we had outlined, and thus faced some challenges. On Wednesday, we resumed our use of Pivotal Tracker and found ourselves on track again. At that time, our communication with each other also greatly improved.
